## Publish a version

Build and test the project with these commands
```sh
npm run build
npm run test
```

You can see what files will be embedded in the new release with the command below. Files and directories listed in **.gitignore** and **.npmignore** won't be in the package.
```sh
npm pack
```

Update the package version with one of the following commands. If inside a Git directory, the **package.json** file's version is changed and committed. And a new Git tag related to the new version is created.
```sh
npm version prerelease --preid=alpha
npm version prerelease --preid=beta
npm version prerelease --preid=rc
npm version patch
npm version minor
npm version major
```

Push the new Git tag to remote origin
```sh
git push --tags
```

Go to the root of the project, and publish publicly the new package version to the NPM registry. Once published a version can be deprecated, but it cannot be deleted and re-used.
```sh
npm publish --access public
```
